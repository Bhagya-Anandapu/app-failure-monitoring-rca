# 🚨 Application Failure Monitoring & RCA Simulator

This project was built to explore how different types of failures occur in real applications and to showcase my ability to observe, analyze, and reason about system behavior under failure conditions.

The focus is on deliberately triggering failures, capturing meaningful logs, and understanding what went wrong through structured analysis.

## 🧪 Failure Scenarios Implemented

Application failures

Runtime errors caused by invalid input or unexpected conditions

File system issues

Missing files and incorrect file paths

Database connection failures

Connectivity and configuration-related errors

Retry behavior

Multiple attempts before marking an operation as failed

All failures are intentionally simulated to study system behavior under error conditions.

## 🔍 What This Project Demonstrates

- Designing realistic failure scenarios

- Capturing execution details using structured logging

- Analyzing failures using logs instead of assumptions

- Identifying root causes clearly and systematically

- Reasoning across multiple layers:

- - Application logic

- - File system

- - Database access

## 🛠️ Approach

Rather than focusing on feature development, this project emphasizes:

- Thoughtful experimentation

- Clear observation of failures

- Log-driven analysis

- Correctness and clarity in problem-solving

Failures are introduced, observed through logs, and analyzed to understand patterns and behavior.

## 📌 Summary

This project reflects a hands-on approach to understanding how systems behave when things go wrong, and highlights my ability to investigate issues methodically using logs, scripts, and structured analysis.
