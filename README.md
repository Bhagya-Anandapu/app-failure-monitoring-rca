# Application Failure Monitoring & RCA Simulator

This project simulates real-world production failures in an application
environment and demonstrates how support engineers detect, analyze,
and resolve issues using logs, scripts, and structured RCA.

## Failure Scenarios Covered
- Application crash due to invalid input
- Database connection failure
- API timeout / error response
- File not found & permission issues
- Performance degradation due to slow queries

## Key Focus
- Log analysis
- Root cause identification
- Troubleshooting across layers (App, DB, OS)
